# IIITNR Campus Credits - Stellar Blockchain Project

## 🚀 Project Details

**Name:** IIITNR Campus Credits
**Technology Stack:** Rust, Stellar Soroban SDK, WASM, Soroban CLI
**Duration:** 2-day Bootcamp Project
**Network:** Stellar Testnet (Futurenet)

## 💡 Project Description

IIITNR Campus Credits is a simple decentralized credit management system built on the **Stellar Soroban blockchain** using **Rust**. The project introduces a token-based system that allows IIIT Naya Raipur students to earn, store, and spend campus credits. Each student is issued tokens (credits) that can be used for internal college activities like canteen purchases, club memberships, hackathon rewards, or event registrations.

This project demonstrates how **smart contracts** can be used to build transparent and tamper-proof reward systems within educational institutions.

## 🌈 Project Vision

To create a **decentralized and transparent student credit ecosystem** that replaces traditional manual reward systems with blockchain-backed tokens. The goal is to promote trust, automation, and easy management of student incentives, while giving students hands-on exposure to blockchain in real-world use.

## 🔑 Key Features

* **Credit Token System:** Mint, transfer, and burn campus tokens.
* **Admin Access Control:** Only authorized admins can mint or distribute credits.
* **Student Wallets:** Each student has their unique on-chain wallet address.
* **Secure Transactions:** All operations are recorded on Stellar Futurenet.
* **Scalable Design:** Can later integrate with real Stellar mainnet.
* **Rust + WASM Smart Contract:** High performance and secure contract execution.

## 🔮 Future Scope

* Integration with IIITNR ID system for automated student verification.
* Mobile app integration for easy credit transfer and QR-based payments.
* Event-based reward automation (e.g., automatic credit distribution after hackathons).
* Analytics dashboard to track token flow and student engagement.
* Expansion to a full **Campus Blockchain Ecosystem** for rewards, attendance, and resource booking.
